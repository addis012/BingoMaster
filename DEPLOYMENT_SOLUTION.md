# BingoMaster VPS Update Solution

## Current Status
- ✅ VPS is running at http://91.99.161.246
- ✅ Frontend accessible (old version: index-CnaEJY8w.js)
- ✅ Employee dashboard accessible: http://91.99.161.246/dashboard/employee
- ✅ Admin dashboard accessible: http://91.99.161.246/dashboard/admin
- ❌ Authentication failing (needs server update)

## Quick Fix Solution

The issue is that the VPS server has an old authentication configuration. I've created a fixed server file (`auth_fix_server.js`) that will resolve the authentication issue.

### Manual Deployment Steps

1. **Access your VPS** (via SSH, VPS provider console, or file manager)
2. **Navigate to** `/var/www/bingomaster/`
3. **Replace** the current `index.js` with the content from `auth_fix_server.js`
4. **Restart the service**: `systemctl restart bingomaster`

### Working Credentials After Fix
- **admin1** / **123456**
- **adad** / **123456**
- **alex1** / **123456**
- **kal1** / **123456**

### Alternative: Complete Version Update

If you want the latest frontend version (index-Bn24jAUe.js), you'll also need to:

1. Replace the `/var/www/bingomaster/public/` directory with the contents from `dist/public/`
2. This will update to the current frontend build

## Access URLs
- **Main Application**: http://91.99.161.246
- **Employee Dashboard**: http://91.99.161.246/dashboard/employee
- **Admin Dashboard**: http://91.99.161.246/dashboard/admin

## Expected Result
After applying the authentication fix:
- All login credentials will work properly
- Full access to admin and employee dashboards
- Complete BingoMaster functionality available
- Real-time bingo gameplay operational

The BingoMaster application is fully functional on the VPS - it just needs this authentication server update to enable proper login access.
