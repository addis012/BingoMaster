🧩 1. Goal
Keep the current hardcoded cartelas, but make them editable, updateable, and deletable via the admin panel — with full control just like dynamically added cartelas.

Also, support bulk cartela import (update or insert), remove confusing labels like "Fixed" and "Custom," and ensure the system stays fully dynamic.

🧱 2. Admin Cartela Management Panel – Features
🎯 Unified Interface:
✅ Remove or hide “Fixed Cartelas” and “Custom Cartelas” labels

✅ Replace with one title:

Copy
Edit
🧩 Cartela Preview & Management
✅ Display all cartelas (both hardcoded and dynamic) in this format:

makefile
Copy
Edit
CartelaNumber: num1,num2,...,num25
🛠️ Per Cartela Actions:
Action	Behavior
✏️ Edit	Modify the 25-number combination of the cartela (including hardcoded)
🗑️ Delete	Remove any cartela (hardcoded or not) from the system (soft or hard delete)
➕ Add	Create a new cartela if the cartela number is not already used

📥 3. Bulk Cartela Manager – Add or Update Multiple Cartelas
🔄 Functionality:
Admin can paste cartelas in the format:

makefile
Copy
Edit
CartelaNumber:num1,num2,...,num25
For each:

✅ If CartelaNumber exists (hardcoded or not) → update it.

✅ If CartelaNumber is new → insert it.

❌ If invalid (not 25 numbers or missing “free” in the center) → skip it and show a warning.

Example Input:
makefile
Copy
Edit
1:15,22,37,56,65,2,27,41,52,68,7,17,free,23,65,43,45,65,54,34,56,54,56,76,78  
2:5,19,38,51,64,3,24,42,58,69,12,18,free,26,62,4,46,63,55,33,1,53,47,65,71  
99:11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,free,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35
✅ Expected Submission Result:
java
Copy
Edit
🔁 2 cartelas updated (1, 2)
✅ 1 cartela added (99)
❌ 1 cartela skipped (Cartela 3: missing 'free')
🧠 4. Technical Notes
⚙️ Hardcoded cartelas must be loaded into the system (e.g., DB) during setup, if not already present.

✅ These hardcoded entries should be stored with identifiers (e.g., ID = 1, 2...) and not protected — meaning admin edits will directly update them.

🚫 No duplicate cartela numbers allowed.
If submitted again → it overwrites the existing one.

Use SQL like:

sql
Copy
Edit
INSERT INTO cartelas (id, data)
VALUES (?, ?)
ON CONFLICT(id) DO UPDATE SET data = EXCLUDED.data;
👨‍💼 5. Employee Side Behavior
“Select Cartela” dropdown is auto-populated from the cartelas in the database.

If an admin deletes or updates a cartela, employee dropdown reflects changes instantly.

No separation between hardcoded or dynamic — all are treated equally.
